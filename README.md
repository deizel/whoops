# Whoops

Built to seamlessly integrate [Whoops][whoops] with [CakePHP][cakephp].

__This is an unstable repository and should be treated as an alpha.__

## Requirements

* CakePHP 3.x

## Install

Add the plugin to your project's `composer.json` - something like this:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"gourmet/whoops": "*"
	}
}
```

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in its own `composer.json`,
[Composer][composer] will install it inside your /Plugins directory, rather than
in your `vendor-dir`. It is recommended that you add /Plugins/Whoops to your
`.gitignore` file and here's [why][composer:ignore].

As this plugin only offers a Whoops handler for CakePHP, there is no need to
enable it per se. You only need to configure that handler instead of Cake's own
`ErrorHandler` by replacing [this line][bootstrap] in `bootstrap.php` with:

```php
(new \Gourmet\Whoops\Error\WhoopsHandler(Configure::consume('Error')))->register();
```

That's it!
